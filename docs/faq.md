### Who is the target audience? 

BPM Developers, Consultants and Architects.

### What is the "why" behind this?

We want people to focus on building sustainable and future-proof BPM solutions.

### Why is this important now?

Our experience in building process automation solutions showed the importance of the values reflected by the Manifesto. Current market
trends show large digitalization and process automation initiatives being applied across all industries and domains. Those define emerging
requirements on software solutions to deliver high value for scalable and flexible businesses.

### What do the BPM Crafters offer, propose or have in mind?

Next to the Manifesto, focusing on values, we will share our experience and provide a set of best practices, patterns and solutions, applicable during the development of
process applications.
