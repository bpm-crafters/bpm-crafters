## PRs for every change
All changes have to be done in a separate Branch or Fork (if you are an external contributor). As soon as the changes are done please open a PR. If you create a new branch make sure to name it according to what it does (e.g. feat/xyz or fix/xyz). Please use semantic commit messages as described in [here](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716).

## Code reviews
We are using simple emoji's to help convey intention and added meaning in code review comments. A little bit of emoji can go a long way when it comes to code reviews and make giving and receiving code review a little bit more enjoyable. We are following this [guide by erikthedeveloper](https://github.com/erikthedeveloper/code-review-emoji-guide).
